//  Write a program that stores the following data about a soccer player in a structure:
//
//      Player's Name
//      Player's Number
//      Points Scored by Player
//
//  The program should keep an array of 12 of these structures. Each element is for a different
//  player on a team. When the program runs, it should ask the user to enter the data
//  for each player. It should then show a table that lists each player's number, name, and
//  points scored. The program should also calculate and display the total points earned by
//  the team. The number and name of the player who has earned the most points should
//  also be displayed.
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for players' numbers or points scored.
